Q)What are the new things introduced in html 5?
1. ANS-Semantics:
* HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <aside>. These elements provide a clearer structure to web documents, making it easier to understand the purpose and relationship of different parts of a page.
2. Multimedia:
* Native support for audio and video embedding through the <audio> and <video> elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Flash for multimedia playback.
3. Canvas:
* The <canvas> element provides a drawing space for graphics and animations. It allows for dynamic rendering of graphics using JavaScript, enabling the creation of games, charts, and other interactive content.
4. SVG Support:
* HTML5 includes native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing the integration of vector-based graphics directly into HTML documents.
5. Form Controls:
* New input types like email, url, number, and others, along with attributes like placeholder and required, make it easier to create and validate forms without relying on JavaScript.
Q)What are semataics tag give a couple of example?
ANS-Semantic tags in HTML provide meaning to the structure of a web page, making it more understandable for both browsers and developers. Here are a couple of examples of semantic tags introduced in HTML5:
1. <header>:
* The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a group of navigational links. It typically contains headings, logos, and navigation menus for the top of a page.
<header>
    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
<article>:
* The <article> element represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently, such as a news article, blog post, or forum post.
<article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>Content of the article goes here...</p>
</article>
<section>:
* The <section> element is used to group related content within a document. It helps to organize content into thematic groups, and each section can have its own heading.
<section>
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>Content of the section goes here...</p>
</section>
<nav>:
* The <nav> element is used to define a section containing navigation links. It typically includes menus, lists of links, or other navigation-related content.
* <nav>
*     <ul>
*         <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
*         <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
*         <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
*     </ul>
* </nav>
